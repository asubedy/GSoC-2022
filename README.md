# Google Summer of Code 2022 - CNCF at Layer5




#  Project Title: CNCF Cluster: Performance Benchmarking 
A basic aim for this project was to build a benchmarking methodology for different Performance Test that are run on CNCF Cluster using Service Mesh Performance Action. So to achieve this aim, I built a dashboard where users can get a visusal representation of the the test data that are run on the CNCF Cluster. You can read more about the project on the GSoC site [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/GRLPhiag)

## The final result of the project is situated at https://smp-spec.io/dashboard

# Summary
It gives me immense happiness to say that I got this wonderful oppurtunity to work as GSoC CNCF mentee on the Service Mesh Performance project. I have learnt so much during this period of internship. I would like to thank my mentor [Lee Calcote](https://github.com/leecalcote) who guided me and helped me overcome any hump I might have during the entire period of the GSoC. I would also like to thank all the community members for constantly giving me feedbacks and suggesting ways to improve myself and the project I was working on. As the time for this GSoC has come to an end, but I would never hesitate to say that I would still be contributing to this project and fine tune my work to make it more robust.
